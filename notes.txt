maybe todo:
- different thresholds for sell and buy
- maybe add prediction evaluation (prediction mean & std) -> easier to find thresholds
- maybe add percentage threshold for better comparison
- check prediction distribution for max threshold for real data
- train autoencoder to precompute features for faster rl (comma, 2048 features, can use big model)
- trade for one week, gather all data, and check with offline data & performance (binance data vs bybit trading) (retrieve past trading data)
- add all necessary state information (coin, size, profit) (special token design)
- add test split (train, val, test)
- check first day of history for anomaly
- add linear fit slope metric / vs correlation metric
- pretrain on all data, then fine tune on one coin


S5:
- input: OHLCV, output: OHLCV + CV deviation
- preprocessing: log + [maybe normalisation], add coin info, padding
- training: mse loss in latent space
- validation: 5-10% of resources
- evaluation: context length, trend, correlation, etc


future todo:
- seperate klines vs combined network
